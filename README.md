# Timesheet-System

Problem Statement:
ITU School wants to automate the timesheet for its teachers to comply with California Labour Law. They currently have a system based on spreadsheets and emails, and they would like to move to an automated DB solution.

Here are the requirements:

Each Faculty or Staff member needs to submit a Signed timesheet to their manager with the allowed number of hours. It should not exceed the max number allowed for each.
The manager approves or rejects the submitted timesheet.
If the timesheet is approved, it will be forwarded to HR to issue the payment for the employees.
Payroll Cycle also depends on the submitted and approved timesheets.
Employees may be assigned to different projects, and each project can have its own max allowed time per period and pay.
